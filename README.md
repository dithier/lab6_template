## Logistics

For this assignment (and every assignment/lab), you must login into the servers through `your_khoury_name@login.khoury.northeastern.edu` to complete and test your work. 

## Important notes

* Your code **must compile and run** on the Khoury machines to earn credit. Make sure you test your programs on these machines, as this is where we grade your assignments.
* You must commit any additional files (if any) into your repository so we can test your code.
  * Points will be lost if you forget!
* Do not forget, once you have pushed your changes to your repo make sure that you **submit them to Gradescope before the assignment deadline!**

## Discussion questions
You can discuss the following questions with your lab partner about your partition print: 

1. why is the array or subarray printed in each line is the size that it is?

2. which element was used as the pivot in each pass?, and therefore

3. which elements have been swapped?

Your answer should explain this for each recursive call, and explain what the values or p, q, and r are when the base cases are reached, as well as what the output of the code is when the base case is reached.
